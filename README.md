# 🚀 Frictionless Habits
### *An AI + Psychology Powered Habit Builder that reduces friction for good habits and increases friction for bad ones.*

---

## 🌟 Overview  
Most habit apps only **track** habits. They don’t fix the real problem:  
- Good habits are **difficult to start**  
- Bad habits are **too easy to access**  

**Frictionless Habits** combines **behavioral psychology** and **AI personalization** to help users build habits smoothly.  
It redesigns the environment, adds the right amount of friction, and uses smart nudges to keep habits alive.

## ❗ Problem

1. **Good habits have high friction**  
   Small barriers feel overwhelming → procrastination.

2. **Bad habits have low friction**  
   Instant access to distractions → failed routines.

3. **No personalized guidance**  
   Traditional apps don't adapt to user behavior or mood.
